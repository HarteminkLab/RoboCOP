multivariate compete python package. in development


NOTE: as of Dec 5th, the directory pkg/mvcompete/parameters has been deleted. Its contents have been moved to 
pkg/mvcompete/nucleosome/parameters.py
This is because the contents of the parameters/ directory seemed to be used in the same places as /nucleosome/parameters.py 
and there was no reason to clutter up the directory structure with an entire directory called parameters/. 
Examples of what was moved from /parameters/ into /nucleosome/parameters.py:
    from parameters import get_dbf_parameters
    from parameters import mnase_heni_20min_140_160_tf_middle_counts_nb_phi as other_phi
    from parameters import mnase_heni_20min_140_160_tf_middle_counts_nb_mu as other_mu
